VIA University College: Android Development Group: Vidal

To-Do's:
- [x] Create repo
- [x] Decide on subject: Fitness
- [x] Hand in the link
- [x] Overview
- [ ] Document prep
- [ ] For Interaction - get rid of uneccessary toasts and check lifecycle of workout bc of loading the list and the go back button needs to be pressed whenever u swap navigation
- [ ] For Navigation - add an intent (maybe camera for profilepic?)
- [ ] For Firebase make sense of the login (pb upload, list access only if logged in, or just favs if logged in, settings?)

Possible To-Do's:
- [ ] Filter list by category using fab
- [ ] favorites, icon and save them in firebase according to user 
- [ ] intent for camera to upload a profile pic and store it in firebase
- [ ] copypasta workout to nutrition

Requirements:
- [ ] Tabata clock
- [ ] Account to Login track weight, size?
- [ ] Network connection to verify account and fetch new data
- [ ] Page with graphs on personal stats and workouts?
- [ ] Protein calculator
- [ ] Page with health tips + protein boosts(meals)?
- [ ] Page with exercises + filter

Reason: 
I'd like to create a fitness app that includes many different existing fitness apps into one. 
I'd also like to make an account and / or payment optional. So that one can use the app without an account (the core features at least) and without a subscription fee.
